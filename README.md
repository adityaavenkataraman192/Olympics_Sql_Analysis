# üèÖ Olympics SQL Analysis

This project presents an in-depth SQL-based analysis of Olympic Games historical data, exploring trends in country participation, medal distribution, athlete performance, and event statistics. The queries leverage PostgreSQL features including window functions, CTEs, and pivoting with `crosstab`.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

The project uses two core tables:
This project utilizes the [120 Years of Olympic History: Athletes and Results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) dataset from Kaggle. It encompasses detailed records from the modern Olympic Games, spanning from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. The dataset includes information on athletes, events, medals, and participating countries.

- **`olympics_history`**  
  Contains detailed data on athletes, events, teams, medals, and years.
  
- **`olympics_history_noc_regions`**  
  Maps National Olympic Committee (NOC) codes to full country/region names.
